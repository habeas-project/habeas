```

## 6. Run Your Expo App on the Emulator

Once the emulator is running:

```bash
# Navigate to your mobile app directory
cd apps/mobile

# Start Expo on Android
npm run android
```

## 7. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Failed to resolve the Android SDK path"**
   - Check that ANDROID_HOME is set correctly:
   ```bash
   echo $ANDROID_HOME
   ```
   - Verify the SDK exists at that location

2. **"Error: spawn adb ENOENT"**
   - Ensure adb is installed and in your PATH:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   which adb
   ```

3. **Emulator is slow or crashes**
   - Ensure virtualization is enabled in your BIOS
   - For WSL2 users, consider using Android Studio directly in Windows

4. **"Unable to locate adb within SDK"**
   - Install Android SDK Platform-Tools:
   ```bash
   sdkmanager "platform-tools"
   ```

5. **"INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE"**
   - Uninstall the app from the emulator and try again
