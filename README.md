# Habeas

Habeas aims to be a cross-platform mobile application that allows those who are at risk of detention to contact immigration lawyers who are able to file an emergency petition for Habeas Corpus on their behalf and in the appropriate jurisdiction. 

## Background
The recent 5-4 SCOTUS decision allows the administration to continue to deport people under the auspices of the Alien Enemies act of 1798. However, it imposes limits by requiring notice and judicial review through habeas corpus petitions. 

Per Justice Sotoymayor:
> â€œ[D]etainees scattered across the country must each obtain counsel and file habeas petitions on their own accord, all without knowing whether they will remain in detention where they were arrested or be secretly transferred to an alternative location." 

The goal of this project is to make it easier for people to meet that burden by rapidly pairing detained individuals with legal representatives who are able to file those petitions on their behalf and in the appropriate jurisdictions.

## How it works:
When someone is in imminent threat of detention, they or their friends and family can use the app to send a pre-loaded set of information about the detainee to the Habeas service, which will connect them with a lawyer who can file a petition on their behalf. 

Prior to making this connection, no information about the detainee is collected or sent to the service. We can't give your data to anyone else because we don't have it.

## What we need right now:
- Immigration Lawyers
  - Across a range of U.S. jurisdictions
  - Willing to be contacted and accept a case on an emergency basis in order to file a petition for habeas corpus on behalf of someone being detained
- Software Engineers
  - Likely React Native on the front.
  - Discussing back end technologies with an emphasis on support for end-to-end encryption.
  - Security and infrastructure experts always welcome
- People who are bilingual in English and one of:
  - Spanish
  - Mandarin
  - Vietnamese
  - Tagalog
  - Arabic

This project is still in the requirements gathering phase. Updates will follow. There's an amazing team of engineers and lawyers working to build this. Please contact me if you are interested in being involved: habeas-project(at)proton.me
