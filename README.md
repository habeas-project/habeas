# Habeas

Habeas aims to be a cross-platform mobile application that allows those who are at risk of detention to contact immigration lawyers who are able to file an emergency petition for Habeas Corpus on their behalf and in the appropriate jurisdiction. 

What we need right now:
- Immigration Lawyers
  - Across a range of U.S. jurisdictions
  - Willing to be contacted and accept a case on an emergency basis in order to file a petition for habeas corpus on behalf of someone being detained
- Software Engineers
  - Likely React Native on the front.
  - Discussing back end technologies with an emphasis on support for end-to-end encryption.
  - Security and infrastructure experts always welcome
- People who are bilingual in English and one of:
  - Spanish
  - Mandarin
  - Vietnamese
  - Tagalog
  - Arabic

This project is still in the requirements gathering phase. Updates to follow. Please contact me if you are interested in being involved: habeas-project(at)proton.me
